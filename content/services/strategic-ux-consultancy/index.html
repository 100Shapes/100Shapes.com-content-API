            <h2>A digital platfrom for London</h2>
            
            <p>London Live is a British television channel, launched at 6:30pm on 31st March 2014. Combining London news and entertainment, it is broadcast on Freeview channel 8, satellite, cable and online.</p>

            <p>When 100 Shapes were commissioned to design the London Live website we assembled a team of user researchers, user experience designers and information architects to deliver the project with a user-centered approach. Up-front in order to identify genuine user needs, we ran an in-depth audience research study with 10 participants based on a target demographic.</p>

            <p>The study examined the potential opportunities to fit into the lives of the audience members by understanding how well they were served for certain types of information such as news, travel, weather and entertainment.</p>

            <p>By understanding where participants were under-served and comparing that to what was important we were able to identify the biggest opportunities for London Live and inform the design direction.</p>
