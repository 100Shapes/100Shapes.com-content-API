            <h2>What is interactive video?</h2>
            <p>Interactive videos blend video content with user interaction. Visual elements within a video invite viewers to click or tap to perform an action. They can be associated with items in the story, triggered by the timeline or are continually visible as an overlay to the video. Be it gestures, voice, touch or clicks — the richness of the user interaction can run across the spectrum. Interactive videos create multi-layered, immersive, user-driven experiences.</p>

            <h3>Make it memorable</h3>
            <p>Keeping your viewers active will hold their attention for longer, increase engagement, recall, satisfaction and time spent watching a video.</p>

            <h3>Understand your audience</h3>
            <p>Identify what makes your audience tick. Track your viewers’ interactions to determine what grabs their attention and how your video is performing.</p>

            <h2>Designing an interactive video</h2>
            <p>Whether you are selling a product through an interactive video or creating the next cutting edge immersive drama, accomplishing your goals starts with a clear understanding of your objectives and what makes your audience tick. Our process typically includes:</p>

            <h3>1. A clear view of where you are</h3>
            <p>In order to take your product or service forward, you need to know where you are to begin with. We’ll kick things off by gathering information about your business and users.</p>

            <h3>2. Establishing your vision</h3>
            <p>Next it’s time to work out where you want to be. Armed with the information we’ve gathered, we brainstorm and prioritise strategies that have a measurable impact on your business.</p>

            <h3>3. Get the job done</h3>
            <p>With a clear road map of who does what and when, it’s time to roll up our sleeves and implement your vision. Our strategists and designers will create moodboards, wireframes, content maps and designs that detail your entire video experience.</p>

            <h3>4. Incorporating content</h3>
            <p>Content is king! Content and design streams run concurrently to allow them to feed into one another. We work with your team to create a detailed content map that plots exactly where your interactive material features throughout. This process not only helps inform how the video content is scripted, it also determines how the design is presented to your audience.</p>

            <p>Once your project is out in the world, we’ll gather metrics and useful feedback to determine its success. Armed with these insights we’ll make any necessary improvements before tackling the next objective.</p>

            <p>Launched in December 2014, Footballers United is an iWonder commission for the BBC World War One centenary season, produced by Somethin’ Else, user experience and design lead by 100 Shapes.</p>

            <ohs-quote name='Sinead Rocks' role='Head of BBC Learning'>This interactive drama blends high quality video with archived content in a way we’ve never done before; which not only gives the story depth but brings an important topic like WW1 to a new and contemporary audience.</ohs-quote>
