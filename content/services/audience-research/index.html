            <h2>What’s involved?</h2>
            <p>Audience research typically involves conducting carefully-scripted extensive interviews with participants that fit your target audience. Both qualitative and quantitative insights are drawn from the interview data.</p>

            <p>Audience research can also be incorporated into usability testing and includes the following:</p>

            <h3>Defining participant profiles</h3>
            <p>Before we can kick things off, we need to identify who your target audience is. We then recruit 10 or more participants that reflect these characteristics. Ideally, the participants are potential users themselves.</p>

            <h3>Recruiting the participants</h3>
            <p>Once we have a profile, we screen and select users who meet the criteria. It is vital for the collecting of reliable data that the participants match the defined profile. There is a lead time of 2-4 weeks involved in this process, and participants are paid an incentive to cover their time and travel expenses.</p>

            <h3>Writing interview scripts and capture forms</h3>
            <p>Detailed interview scripts are prepared in advance to ensure a consistent and targeted approach to the research. We run scripts past your team first to make sure we cover everything that's important.</p>

            <h3>Conducting interviews and note-taking</h3>
            <p>Interviews are conducted by a user researcher under controlled conditions in a lab, workplace or user’s home. To make sure everything is captured, sessions are recorded and usually accompanied by a note-taker.</p>

            <h3>Reporting findings</h3>
            <p>The findings are presented in a detailed report which becomes an important reference during the design process. What’s more, it often uncovers opportunities for new services or features.</p>

            <h2 class='mt0'>When to consider audience research</h2>
            <p>Audience research is most valuable in the initial stages of a project — be it before embarking on the design of a new product or making major changes to an existing product. It is also beneficial when you are expanding to target a new audience or market segment.</p>

            <p>If you already have a live product and have a good knowledge of your customer base, audience research is probably not necessary.</p>

            <p>Audience research does not explore participants’ reactions to a new system or their usage of any existing system in detail. If this is what you need, <a href="#">usability testing</a> will give you these insights.</p>

            <p>The lead time to recruit suitable participants, plan and conduct interviews and analyse data can vary, so please ensure that you allocate enough time within your schedule to carry out audience research.</p>

            <p>If you have a tight deadline, the lead time to recruit suitable participants, combined with the time required for planning and analysis might mean that audience research has to be ruled out.</p>

            <h3>Incorporate existing interfaces</h3>
            <p>Easily embed responsive interfaces and websites into your interactive display.</p>

            <p>Our researchers work with a range of methods to understand your users, providing both qualitative and quantitative insights and data. Typical research methods include:</p>

            <h3>Depth interviews</h3>
            <p>Conducting face-to-face depth interviews is a highly effective way of gaining an understanding of your audience’s goals, motivations and behaviours. Interviews are carefully scripted and usually run with 10 or more participants who fit your target audience’s profile.</p>

            <h3>Focus groups</h3>
            <p>Focus groups are a great way of finding out about the beliefs, attitudes and aspirations of the audience you are designing for. These moderated discussions enable a quick and valuable understanding of the expectations and experiences of your targeted group of individuals.</p>

            <h3>Card sorting</h3>
            <p>Often incorporated into depth interviews, card sorting is a simple method that helps evaluate what matters the most to your audience. Participants organise and rank topics written on cards into categories in a way that makes sense to them. This enables our information architects to identify and prioritise the display of information in your product or service.</p>

            <h2>A digital platfrom for London</h2>
            <p>London Live is a British television channel, launched at 6:30pm on 31st March 2014. Combining London news and entertainment, it is broadcast on Freeview channel 8, satellite, cable and online.</p>

            <p>When 100 Shapes were commissioned to design the London Live website we assembled a team of user researchers, user experience designers and information architects to deliver the project with a user-centered approach. Up-front in order to identify genuine user needs, we ran an in-depth audience research study with 10 participants based on a target demographic.</p>

            <p>The study examined the potential opportunities to fit into the lives of the audience members by understanding how well they were served for certain types of information such as news, travel, weather and entertainment.</p>

            <p>By understanding where participants were under-served and comparing that to what was important we were able to identify the biggest opportunities for London Live and inform the design direction.</p>
