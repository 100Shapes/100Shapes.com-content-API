            <h2>What is a Heuristic evaluation</h2>
            <p>A usability specialist will conduct a thorough audit of your website or app, benchmarking each page or feature for fitness, based on best-practice usability heuristics ('rules of thumb'). Some of the factors we consider are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Navigation</li>
                <li>Information architecture</li>
                <li>Layout</li>
                <li>Legibility</li>
                <li>Interaction</li>
                <li>Visual consistency</li>
                <li>Signposting and calls to action</li>
                <li>Use of imagery</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each feature is given ratings based on a simple ‘traffic light’ system:</p>
            <p><span class="fwm fg--red">Red</span> - Urgent action required. A serious issue that is likely to be a pain-point to users, directly affecting exit/bounce rates and conversion.</p>
            <p><span class="fwm fg--yellow">Amber</span> - Simple fix or consideration for improvement. A small problem with a quick and obvious solution. Or, a larger issue with only a moderate impact on usability.</p>
            <p><span class="fwm fg--green">Green</span> - No action required. A feature that works well and should be retained.</p>
            <p>You will receive a detailed report, which includes explanations for each rating, and written recommendations for 'quick fix' solutions, where appropriate. This can be a valuable reference for future development.</p>

            <h2>When to consider heuristic evaluation</h2>
            <p>Heuristic evaluation is perfect if you're considering making some 'quick fix' improvements to your product or you want to bring it in line with usability best-practice.</p>

            <p>Heuristic evaluation is most useful when combined with insights into actual users - perhaps you've collected customer feedback or have seen interesting behaviour in website analytics, or maybe you've done some usability testing in the past? It's always much better to approach a heuristic review with specific areas of focus in mind.</p>

            <p>On its own, heuristic evaluation is limited. Even an experienced usability specialist can't predict exactly how a user in the real world might behave, particularly if the product has a specific audience. Usability testing is the best, possible way to evaluate how real users behave and react.</p>

            <p>Heuristic review is also limited to the evaluating the product you already have. If you're planning an expansion or major re-design, you should consider audience research, and also usability testing as part of the design process.</p>
