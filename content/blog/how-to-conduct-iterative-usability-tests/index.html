            <p class="lead">You’re planning a new feature for your product; you need to know that it will work for your customers and meet the needs of your business.  Poor navigation, layout, messaging and styling are only some of the hidden dangers which could render your product dead in the water.</p>

            <p>These types of usability issues can only be identified through some form of usability testing, but by taking an iterative approach to the design, you have the opportunity to fix them long before your feature is released.</p>

            <p>‘Iterative usability testing’ is the process of conducting usability tests, on a regular basis, throughout the design and development lifecycle. It differs from more-formal testing because customers are involved at every stage of the project, rather than just at the end; it causes the design direction to change gradually, rather than in a huge panic at the end.</p>

            <p>Recently spoke about how we used it while designing a new music discovery app for BBC Radio 3. Testing the design in this way allows you to get a lot more out of the designers working on the feature. The immediate benefits are remarkable:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Plenty of opportunities to gather additional audience research</li>
                <li>Quick validation of design ideas before any more resource is wasted</li>
                <li>Powerful arguments to present to stakeholders and get agreement</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This guide will introduce the steps involved in running your own iterative usability testing process.</p>

            <h2>How to organise iterative usability testing</h2>

            <p>Here are the steps describing how you can conduct your own iterative testing:</p>

            <h3 class="mb0">1. Create profiles. It’s important to test with people who match your target customers.</h3>
            <p>Without targeted profiles, you can only iron out the most obvious usability issues.</p>

            <h3 class="mb0">2. Recruit participants. Find people that fit your profile.</h3>
            <p>You can either leverage your existing customer base, or work with recruitment agencies.</p>

            <h3 class="mb0">3. Schedule regular appointments</h3>
            <p>Book a series of appointments, at regular intervals, throughout the design and development process. Usually we find that once a fortnight or every sprint provides enough time to prepare for testing and react to your findings.</p>

            <h3 class="mb0">4. Write testing scripts</h3>
            <p>Before each session, write a testing script for any outstanding design questions or research you want to collect.</p>

            <h3 class="mb0">5. Run the testing</h3>
            <p>Conduct the testing with the help of a colleague who can take notes. It’s useful to record the audio to refer back to and publish on a wiki for others to listen.</p>

            <h3 class="mb0">6. Amend the designing</h3>
            <p>Process the findings to get an idea of the types of things which have to change.</p>

            <h3 class="mb0">7. Repeat</h3>
            <p>Repeat step 4 ready for the next round.</p>

            <h2>5 tips for running usability testing</h2>

            <h3 class="mb0">1. Remember the incentives</h3>
            <p>You need to thank people for their time and opinions. The usual way to do this is with incentives. On average, you can pay upwards of £50-£100 to be given to people upon completion of the test.</p>

            <p>However, with the preparing of the designs and scripts, it’s easy to forget the cash to pay your participants. Put a reminder in the calendar and get the incentives organised beforehand.  </p>

            <h3 class="mb0">2. Make people feel welcome</h3>
            <p>Tea, coffee, plenty of biscuits and bags of Haribo all make people feel welcome. Get to know them a little, thank them for their time and generally make them feel comfortable. Remind them that you aren’t testing them, rather the experience. Encourage them to ‘think allowed’.</p>

            <h3 class="mb0">3. People are late (and early)</h3>
            <p>Make sure to plan plenty of time between sessions to reset. While participants have to wait, they need a place to sit and wait if there’s an issue with the scheduling.</p>

            <h3 class="mb0">4. Using your existing customers</h3>
            <p>Using existing customers might be cheaper, but they will skip over usability issues which new customers might struggle with.</p>

            <h3 class="mb0">5. Beware the seasoned tester!</h3>
            <p>It’s possible that some people have already attended their fair share of testing sessions and are just going through the motions to get their incentive. In order to get the most out of usability testing you want honest feedback, watch out for participants who are too eager to please or have an unusually impressive grasp of technical language.</p>

            <h2>Audience focused design</h2>

            <p>Iterative usability testing is an extremely useful tool when it's baked into the design process. Real feedback from users will give the design team the valuable insights they need to shape the product into something your customers will love.</p>
