			<p>Working in the digital industry, the word ‘innovation’ can sound a touch hackneyed but to my mind, innovation leads to two clear outcomes: change and progress.</p>

			<p>In light of the BBC Charter Review, where the mission and purpose of the BBC are being re-examined, change and progress are two things ‘Auntie’ is in search of.</p>

			<p>To truly innovate, team leaders, designers, producers, product owners et al need the right conditions: to feel unconstrained by what’s gone before; to have a clear grasp of their market and the competition; to operate outside of their comfort zone; to be prepared to work hard and as part of a team.</p>

			<p>I think this final point - teamwork - is the most important. Google, Apple and Facebook are companies that have excelled in their respective industries to be considered innovative. Yet, these achievements are often linked to the efforts of an individual - Steve Jobs, Sergey Brin or Mark Zuckerberg. That’s not the case. These companies have thrived on the collective effort of the talented teams they put together. Teams of people who shared their vision and were willing to put in the hours.</p>

			<p>With an average international audience of 308 million per week, the BBC has huge global reach and as such needs to be innovating like those other tech giants.</p>

			<h2>Planning to plan</h2>
			
			<p>At a recent speech made to members of the Creative Industries Federation, Director General Tony Hall said:</p>

			<p>“I want to open the BBC to become - even more - Britain’s creative partner, to become a platform for this country’s incredible talent, cultural institutions and open up to our audiences in new ways”.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="grid-item sm-1/1 lg-8/12">
			<p>These plans follow Arnando Iannucci’s  “We’re All in this Together” MacTaggart speech and clearly outline industry partnerships as instrumental in helping the Beeb navigate it’s way through the questions raised in the BBC Charter Review.</p>

			<p>Tony Hall intends to transform the BBC into  “an internet-first organisation to open it up to great opportunities for our audiences and creative industries”.</p>

			<p>Or rather, turn cumbersome Auntie into a more astute, in-the-know, 21st century creative partner.</p>

			<p>The Charter acknowledges that “the media sector and the UK economy has benefited from the BBC’s role in innovation with the BBC undertaking research and development which would not have been picked up by the wider market.“</p>

			<p>To demonstrate it can develop new ideas - those that capture the imagination and lead the way for the rest of the industry, like a certain BBC iPlayer - it will need to develop ever closer partnerships with those from the creative and digital industries.</p>

			<h2>Planning to plan</h2>

			<p>The user experience and design department at the BBC has collaborated with external suppliers for sometime. Each top-level product from BBC News to Radio & Music have a dedicated external agency that at times will have designers embedded onsite with internal team members.</p>

			<p>More recently they have set up ‘Connected Studio’ – its programme for delivering innovation. Run by a team of passionate individuals, Connected Studio brings BBC staff closer to the wider Digital industry. 100 Shapes is a seasoned collaborator, having first attended one of its early events working on new ideas for BBC iPlayer in 2012.</p>

			<p>3 years on it has worked with pretty much all of the BBC’s online offerings from CBBC to BBC Sport, delivering 27 Pilots, 8 of which are on their way to becoming full fledged audience facing products.</p>

			<h2>The Connected Studio Process</h2>
			
			<p>Every idea needs a clear route to be executed well.  Working with teams from across the BBC and external digital agencies, The Connected Studio programme include workshops and creative sessions designed to guide that idea from scribble-on-Pret-napkin to a fully-functioning, interactive drama, classical music app or off-beat comedy show.</p>

			<p>Through the BBC’s Connected Studio scheme, 100 Shapes has delivered large screen experiences for BBC iPlayer, introduced younger people to classical music and developed experimental documentary storytelling.</p>
			
			<p>These are digital experiences often produced on small budgets with a speedy turnaround. They are hosted on a public-facing platform called BBC Taster where they can be tried and tested by the public and feedback can be gathered.</p>
			
			<h2>Finding purpose</h2>

			<p>The BBC plays a unique role in the cultural life of this country. With the creative and technology industries being such an important part of the UK economy, developing partnerships with those with ideas and technological know-how will help the Beeb be truly innovative, quicken their journey into being an internet-first organisation and define their purpose as a public service.</p>
