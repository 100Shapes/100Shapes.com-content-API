			<p>Launched alongside the First World War centenary commemorations, <a href="http://footballersunited.pilots.bbcconnectedstudio.co.uk/">Footballers United</a> is a unique interactive online drama set in Edinburgh during the conflict.</p>

			<p>Revolving around a group of young men and women as they cope with their new reality, it’s a story of how Scottish professional football was used to bring fans and friends to the front and about the women who stayed behind, became independent and even took their place on the pitch — only to face a 50-year football ban.</p>

			<p>Seamlessly blending technology, design and writing it combines a World War One drama with photos, documents and original video and neatly knits it all together with an interactive timeline.</p>

			<p>For a more personal experience it allows viewers to map the events to their own social graph by signing in via Facebook; showing how their friends would have fared throughout the war.</p>

			<p>A technical and creative tour de force – it was designed to explore the potential of interactive platforms in the service of great storytelling.</p>

				This interactive drama blends high quality video with archived content in a way we’ve never done before; which not only gives the story depth but brings an important topic like WW1 to a new and contemporary audience.
