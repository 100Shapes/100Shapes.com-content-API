            <p>Footballers United is a unique interactive online drama set in Edinburgh during World War One and revolving around two young men and two young women as they cope with their new reality.</p>

            <p>An impressive blending of technology, design and writing in the service of storytelling, it combines a World War One drama and archive material in a way never seen before.</p>

            <p>A poignant window into early 20th Century Edinburgh, it’s a story of how Scottish professional football was used to bring fans and friends to the front, and about the women who stayed behind, worked, became independent and even took their place on the pitch — only to face a 50 -year football ban.</p>

            <p>Every element of the story and the archive material that inspired it can be shared online. An interactive timeline knits everything together — archive content such as photos and documents, and original video.</p>

            <p>For a more personal experience you can sign in via Facebook mapping the events to your own social graph; showing how your friends would have fared throughout the war.</p>

            <p>A technical and creative tour de force – it was designed to explore the potential of interactive platforms for narrative purposes.</p>

                This interactive drama blends high quality video with archived content in a way we’ve never done before; which not only gives the story depth but brings an important topic like WW1 to a new and contemporary audience.

            <p>Conversely, there’s a huge opportunity with new audiences - namely the digital savvy Radio 4 listeners who don’t yet come to Radio 3 but are interested in classical music and, given a nudge might crossover into the classical world.</p>

            <p>This provided us with a distinctive challenge. How might we create a deeper, richer experience for both those with a passion for classical as well as attract those who are simply curious (and ready to be converted).</p>
