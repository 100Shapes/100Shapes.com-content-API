            <p class="lead">We’ve very excited to announce the launch of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/taster/projects/symphinity">BBC Symphinity.</a></p>

            <p>If you’re a fan of the odd classical tune but feel a bit daunted by the sheer breadth of choice on offer, BBC Symphinity is for you. It gives you expertly selected collections of classical music from the BBC’s unparalleled output of live performances.</p>

            <p>Each week you’ll find a new collection of compositions connected by a simple, sometimes curious theme. Sit back and enjoy some well know classics or forgotten gems, whilst Symphinity presents you with short passages and excerpts about the composers and their music.</p>

            <h2>Discovering Classical</h2>

            <p>Where did it all start? Last year, 100 Shapes was commissioned to create this classical music discovery app following a successful pitch as part of the BBC’s program for developing innovation known as Connected Studio.</p>

            <p>Currently the majority of BBC Radio 3’s classical output is enjoyed by a hefty fanbase of 2 million committed listeners. But a principle challenge set by the Radio 3 team was to develop new forms of digital engagement for both their existing audience and entirely new ones.</p>

            <h2>Classical music lovers and likers</h2>

            <p>The Radio 3 audience is passionate about classical music but less than 10% of its listeners currently engage with their website or digital services.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item 1/1 lg-6/12">
            <p>Conversely, there’s a huge opportunity with new audiences - namely the digital savvy Radio 4 listeners who don’t yet come to Radio 3 but are interested in classical music and, given a nudge might crossover into the classical world.</p>

            <p>This provided us with a distinctive challenge. How might we create a deeper, richer experience for both those with a passion for classical as well as attract those who are simply curious (and ready to be converted).</p>

    <div class="grid grid-align-center">
        <div class="grid-item sm-1/1 lg-8/12">  
            <p>For both audiences, they’re missing out on a deeper, richer experience through which their passion for classical music or curiosity about it can be better served.<p>

            <p>Symphinity aims to serve that need.</p>

                What we’re trying to do with Symphinity is use the stories about classical music, about the artists and composers and the periods that they lived in, to give people really easy ways to get into it.

            <h2>How does it work?</h2>

            <p>The BBC and Radio 3 have an extensive, ever growing library of world class classical recordings. Unfortunately your average classical fan is unaware it exists.</p>

            <p>Symphinity aims to rectify this by regularly showcasing the best of this music with themed playlists. Each one curated by the classical experts from Radio 3.</p>

            <div class="tc">
                <img src="bbc-symphinity-playlists.png">
                <figcaption>Choose from a range of differently themed playlists</figcaption>
            </div>

            <p>Whether it’s a collection of “the greatest innovators in the history of the keyboard” or “fine examples of musical Romantics” or even “a journey through more than a hundred years of symphonic thought” there’s a playlist that should appeal to any classical sensibility.</p>

            <p>Each playlist is accompanied by short passages and excerpts that describe the music you're listening to with - often curious - facts about the composers who created it.</p>

            <div class="tc">
                <img src="bbc-symphinity-excerpts.png">
                <figcaption>Small excerpts display whilst you listen to describe the stories behind the music</figcaption>
            </div>

            <p>Neatly presented in a responsive website, Symphinity hopes to provide classical enthusiasts with access to classical recordings they may otherwise have missed. And a straightforward pathway for discovery for those who are classically curious.</p>

            <p>Discover that Hadyn enjoyed parmesan or that Mendelssohn secretly published several of his sister’s works under his name. From comical to informative - Symphinity opens up the classical world by revealing the stories that surround the music.</p>

                Classical can seem like a huge world, so it's often hard to know where to start. We’re hoping that Symphinity will help introduce people to the genre, while providing those who already love it with something new.

            <p>Symphinity is being showcased for the next 3 months on the BBC Taster - a home for new ideas from the BBC.
