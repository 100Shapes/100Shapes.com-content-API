            <p class="fz+">We all have them. Forlorn in our cupboards, forgotten under our beds, abandoned in the garage and alone on top of that hard-to-reach shelf. That once cutting edge piece of technology now lying somewhere in a dark corner like unvisited tombstones.</p>

            <p>On demand video providers such as ITV use a variety of tools to stream targeted advertising pre, during and after their programmes. One tool they use is <a href="http://brainient.com/en/">Brainient</a> who have pioneered the "interactive advert" - a new type of ad which allows users to click and manipulate ads in order to increase their engagement. This new type of advert has helped brainient stick out from the sea of interactive advertising platforms and become a compelling option for large media organisations.</p>

        <div class="grid-item sm-1/1 lg-8/12">
            <p>We recently developed an interactive video marketing prototype for ITV, using Brainient’s interactive advertising technology.</p>

            <h2>List of the dead</h2>

            <p>Just think about the dearly departed: VCRs, iPods, old desktops, zip drives, mobile phones, Ataris, Gameboys, PDAs, 8-tracks, walkmans, discmans, tamagotchis, handheld LCD games, film roll cameras, modems, combi TV/VCR... With technology arriving with built-in expiry dates, we’re at the mercy of kamikaze gadgets and expeditious tech trends.</p>

            <h2>Eulogy to a MiniDisc player</h2>

            <p>Today I rediscovered one such obsolete piece of technology: my MiniDisc player. On seeing this arcane music player (which was difficult since it was covered with a decade’s worth of dust), I felt a pang of remorse. I remember just how much I wanted it back then. Needed it, even. With the MD player retailing at £200 in Argos, I spent most of that year saving up for the one which had the record function as well as a radio tuner. For some reason, radio was always important in my music device choice.</p>

            <p>Anyway, I thought the MD was the future of music and MiniDiscs would have the longevity of the floppy disk (back then 30 years of anything seemed like a long time). I think it was after two dedicated years of use, I realised I couldn’t keep buying coats with big pockets to accommodate its bulky shape. Now I have no idea what to do with it. Well, I guess writing a blog post about it counts as something. Other than that, I just have to hope it’s worth a small fortune in another 20 years time... I wonder if Ebay will still be around then?</p>

            <h2>There’s gold in my phone?</h2>

            <p>Despite my ever growing collection of deceased tech, I can’t seem to bring myself to part with them. Call it sentiment or perhaps possessiveness - the point is, if I can’t use it, no one can. Shame really, because I’m apparently sitting on a little goldmine. With precious metals such as gold and iridium being used to make mobile phones I should think about learning how to extract them and selling it to dentists for their gold fillings.</p>

            <h2>The startling predictions</h2>

            <p>WEEE recycling is one way to preserve the finite reserves of metals. The forecast is dark if we don’t. Judging by New Scientist’s predictions, we could run out of the rarer metals within the next 20 years unless we come up with alternatives, which no doubt we will...until we run of that too. Maybe at that point I’ll take out my Sony Ericcson Z200 or K800 and laugh at those who can’t buy mobile phones any more.</p>

            <h2>What to do with my tech?</h2>

            <p>There are companies like Mazuma and Envirophone who give you money to save the planet. Not to mention bigger tech companies and supermarket chains who have recycle initiatives. However, I sometimes wonder if there’s something else we can do with our sad archaic technology.</p>

            <h2>The future</h2>

            <p>The future would be to create technology that didn’t have planned obsolescence built into its design. Something a bit like this ingenious idea. Imagine applying that level of customisation and upgradability to every bit of technology you owned…? Yet, I feel we’re still missing something important here.</p>

            <p>Maybe the sentiment which has led me to keep all my phones is the very sentiment we should also be applying to design. This is the idea behind emotionally durable design: how can technology be designed so we want to keep it long past its death?</p>

            <p>For my phones and my MiniDisc player, it’s the memories attached to them that make me keep them. They’re little visual reminders of the past MEs. Farewell, old technology; I remember you fondly. For that short time, you were my favourite thing.</p>

            <p>Rest in peace my shiny little friends!</p>

                <li>Pick a swf layout for the type of advert you want</li>
                <li>Add your artwork</li>
                <li>Wire up the buttons to CTAs or URLs</li>
                <li>Save and deploy the advert</li>
            </ol>

            <p>When the advert is played it loads the chosen .swf, pulls in the assets uploaded to the website and pipes down a complete advert.</p>

            <p>This is great for most use cases of interactive adverts but we needed something more flexible. Our itv prototype required a platform and a controller for advert to browser communication and client-side DOM manipulation (html of the page).</p>

            <p>This allows us to insert new UI elements to the page outside the video/advert content. To surface these extra capabilities, we leveraged Brainient’s ‘custom .swf’ feature to inject and load an entire JavaScript <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a> app into the page.</p>

            <h2>6 steps to create an interactive advert using Brainient &amp; <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React.js</a></h2>

           	<ol>
                <li>The custom .swf object loads the required JS files from a URL specified in the ‘advert creation’ admin site.</li>
                <li>The JS file loads the app and inserts the required DOM elements (if not done already).</li>
                <li>The JS app plays one of the specified adverts</li>
                <li>The JS app knows and sends what adverts have been watched by the user</li>
                <li>The JS app adds any saved ads to a newly inserted toolbar in the DOM.</li>
                <li>The TV content plays when all adverts are complete.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Platforms and modern tools like Brainient and React.js are enabling broadcasters to develop evermore exciting and compelling technologies such as interactive videos helping to create stronger bonds with their audience.</p>
