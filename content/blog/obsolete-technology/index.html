With technology arriving with built-in expiry dates, we’re at the mercy of kamikaze gadgets and expeditious tech trends.</p>

            <h2>Eulogy to a MiniDisc player</h2>

            <p>Today I rediscovered one such obsolete piece of technology: my MiniDisc player. On seeing this arcane music player (which was difficult since it was covered with a decade’s worth of dust), I felt a pang of remorse. I remember just how much I wanted it back then. Needed it, even. With the MD player retailing at £200 in Argos, I spent most of that year saving up for the one which had the record function as well as a radio tuner. For some reason, radio was always important in my music device choice.</p>

                <figcaption>Aah, Minidisc player...you always looked so shiny & current</figcaption>
            </figure>
           
            <p>Anyway, I thought the MD was the future of music and MiniDiscs would have the longevity of the floppy disk (back then 30 years of anything seemed like a long time). I think it was after two dedicated years of use, I realised I couldn’t keep buying coats with big pockets to accommodate its bulky shape. Now I have no idea what to do with it. Well, I guess writing a blog post about it counts as something. Other than that, I just have to hope it’s worth a small fortune in another 20 years time... I wonder if Ebay will still be around then?</p>

            <p>Despite my ever growing collection of deceased tech, I can’t seem to bring myself to part with them. Call it sentiment or perhaps possessiveness - the point is, if I can’t use it, no one can. Shame really, because I’m apparently sitting on a little goldmine. With precious metals such as gold and iridium being used to make mobile phones I should think about learning how to extract them and selling it to dentists for their gold fillings.</p>

            <h2>The startling predictions</h2>

            <p>WEEE recycling is one way to preserve the finite reserves of metals. The forecast is dark if we don’t. Judging by New Scientist’s predictions, we could run out of the rarer metals within the next 20 years unless we come up with alternatives, which no doubt we will...until we run of that too. Maybe at that point I’ll take out my Sony Ericcson Z200 or K800 and laugh at those who can’t buy mobile phones any more.</p>

            <h2>What to do with my tech?</h2>

            <p>There are companies like Mazuma and Envirophone who give you money to save the planet. Not to mention bigger tech companies and supermarket chains who have recycle initiatives. However, I sometimes wonder if there’s something else we can do with our sad archaic technology.</p>

            <h2>The future</h2>

            <p>The future would be to create technology that didn’t have planned obsolescence built into its design. Something a bit like this ingenious idea. Imagine applying that level of customisation and upgradability to every bit of technology you owned…? Yet, I feel we’re still missing something important here.</p>

            <p>Maybe the sentiment which has led me to keep all my phones is the very sentiment we should also be applying to design. This is the idea behind emotionally durable design: how can technology be designed so we want to keep it long past its death?</p>

            <p>For my phones and my MiniDisc player, it’s the memories attached to them that make me keep them. They’re little visual reminders of the past MEs. Farewell, old technology; I remember you fondly. For that short time, you were my favourite thing.</p>

            <p>Rest in peace my shiny little friends!</p>
