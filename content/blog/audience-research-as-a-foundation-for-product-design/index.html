            <p class="lead">Understanding audiences is fundamental to user experience design and to any user-centred design process. But how do we put this into practice?</p>

            <p>For an existing product or service there may be a wealth of user insights and feedback, but for a new product, formal audience research is invaluable, and that’s exactly what we did for London Live.</p>

            <p>Before embarking on any design for London Live, we conducted in-depth audience research in order to identify strategic opportunities for London Live within the online space. We interviewed 10 participants spanning London Live’s target demographic.
                We explored their daily travel, social, working life, their internet and technology usage, and their consumption of news, video and other media. This gave us the insights we needed to design a digital platform that would fit into their
                daily lives.</p>


            <p>Audience research is different from usability research in that it examines users’ behaviours and motivations rather than their usage of a particular product, although both are necessary for a user-centred design process. Audience research
                for UX is also different from market research - it is not concerned with market size, pricing or how to market a particular product idea. Instead it helps us identify the problems that users are trying to solve in their lives in order
                that we might use design to solve them in new better ways.</p>

            <h2>‘Why?’ is the golden question</h2>

            <p>Asking ‘why?’ is the key to gaining meaningful insights. It’s not easy or comfortable to ask or be asked. We don’t typically enjoy dissecting our own behaviour because it makes us question whether we’re normal. ‘Why?’ is inherently accusational
                - it reminds us of being at school. But, asking ‘why?’ is essential to understand the motivations that lie behind behaviour patterns, and there are ways to make it friendlier. Phrases like ‘How come you like...?’ or ‘What is it that makes
                you do...?’ are more reflective and less confrontational.</p>

            <p>Pinpointing the key insights Shared patterns of behaviour within the participant group indicate common goals. One of the topics we explored with participants in out London Live study was local weather information. We asked participants who
                were interested in local weather information not only what they used to check the weather, or ‘when?’ or ‘where?’, but ‘why?’.</p>

    <div class="grid grid-align-center">
        <div class="grid-item sm-1/1 lg-8/12">

            <p>We discovered that weather was important to all of the target audience members we spoke to. Nothing unusual there, but what was relevant was that all had the same motivation for checking the weather; to to answer the question “Do I need a
                jacket or umbrella?”.</p>

            <h2>Turning insights into design direction</h2>

            <p>Our weather insight may seem not seem significant, but it gave us the vital steer we needed to tailor London Live’s weather information to its audience’s needs.</p>

            <p>Our research told us:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Users need to access weather information quickly</li>
                <li>Users don’t need detail, just temperature and rainfall</li>
            </ol>

            <p>In a space that’s already saturated with weather services - apps, websites, daily papers, TV and radio bulletins - this is valuable information that we can apply directly to the product. Specifically, that our users don't need data like air
                pressure and wind speed to create a useful service for our target audience.</p>

            <h2>Meeting audience needs through design</h2>

            <p>We opted to show a weather summary on the global navigation bar, on every page of London Live’s website. Users can see the essential information they need while they’re checking the news, looking for a place to go out or watching TV, without
                the need to go to stop what they're doing and go to a separate destination.</p>

            <p>A summary forecast for the next few days is available by expanding the navigation bar, catering for that all-important outfit planning for the next day (as many of our participants told us they did!).</p>

            <p>We kept text to a minimum and used bold, recognisable icons to communicate weather at a glance.</p>

            <h2>Audience-focused design</h2>

            <p>London Live’s weather example is a simple one, but having a solid foundation of initial research enabled us to apply audience insights to every feature we designed; from catch-up TV and news to commenting and calls to action.</p>

            <p>If you already have a product and existing relationship with your audience, you may already have valuable insights that can be applied directly as design improvements. For London Live, formal audience research was vital as they were creating
                an entirely new platform. A solid appreciation of the audience’s behaviours - and crucially, their goals and motivations - is the best possible basis for successful product design.</p>
